# Final Fantasy 14 Chatlog Color Editor (FFXIVCCC)
This is just a quick Proof of Concept editor to change the chatlog colors to colors not supported by the selector ingame.

I also experimented a bit with unxoring the encrypted .DAT files in the character folder - They use a mix of 0x73, 0x74, and 0x75. 
I haven't really experimented much with modifying them, so if anyone else wants to mess with it, go for it.
